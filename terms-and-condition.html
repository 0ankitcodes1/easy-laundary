            All quoted prices are inclusive of Goods and Services Tax and are subject to change without notice. All invoices must be paid as directed by us and we reserve the right to retain your goods until payment in full is received. <br />
            Collection of Garments <br />
            Whilst we shall make every possible effort to process garments within the prescribed time frame we shall not be liable for delays. In the event that garments are not collected within {number of days}, we reserve the right to dispose of them as we see fit and shall not be held liable for any loss that you may suffer in such an event <br />
            Garments Care <br />
            To protect your garments, we follow the Care Label instructions on each item we process. If you request garment treatment that is contradictory to that indicated on the Care Label instructions, we will attempt to contact you and advise you of the potential risks associated with proceeding with the treatment. If we are unable to gain your informed approval to proceed, we shall refrain from cleaning the garment in question, or take extensive digital photography of the garment(s) before and/or during cleaning. If you authorize us to proceed, you must assume responsibility for any damage to the garments. We accept no liability for garments that have missing or removed Care Labels.
            We check garments for any damage that could be exacerbated by the laundering/dry-cleaning process. If we have any concerns regarding a garment, we will attempt to contact you and obtain your approval to tailor the garment ahead of cleaning it. If we are unable to gain your approval, we shall refrain from cleaning the garment in question, or take extensive digital photography of the garment(s) before and/or during cleaning. Likewise, if we have any concerns about the colorfastness, age, or condition of the garment, we will similarly contact you to obtain your approval, or return the garment to you untreated, or take extensive digital photography of the garment(s) prior and/or during cleaning. <br />
            Guaranteed Safe Cleaning <br />
            We offer a safe cleaning guarantee. This means we will process every garment we accept safely. This does not mean we will remove every stain from every garment. If it is our professional opinion that stain removal will be unsafe, or will compromise our safe cleaning guarantee, stain removal efforts will cease. <br />
            Damage <br />
            We exercise the utmost care in cleaning and processing garments entrusted to us and use such processes which, in our opinion, are best suited to the nature and conditions of each individual garment. Nevertheless, we cannot assume responsibility for inherent weaknesses or defects in materials (such as sun fading on curtains) which may result in tears or the development of small holes in fabric that are not readily apparent before processing. In dry-cleaning and laundering, we can not guarantee against color loss, color bleeding, and shrinkage; or damage to weak and tender fabrics.
            Given the delicate nature of some leathers and suedes, all leather and suede garments are cleaned entirely at your own risk, and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for any damage or fading as a result of the dry-cleaning process. <br />
            Our liability concerning any damage to garments caused by us shall not exceed {times} our charge for cleaning that garment regardless of brand or condition. No claims for damages will be recognized unless you advise us of the same within {time} of collecting the garments. <br />
            Loss Of Garments <br />
            We exercise the utmost care in processing garments received to avoid misplacement or loss of items. However, there will be instances where items may get misplaced or lost. As such, we ask that you advise us of any discrepancy within {hours} of picking up your garments so that we may investigate the matter and decide. <br />
            Our liability concerning any lost item shall not exceed {times} our charge for cleaning that garment regardless of brand or condition. <br />
            Personal Items <br />
            Please check all of your garments for money, jewelry, or other valuables before depositing them with us. If we find any valuables in your garments, we will make every effort to return them to you but we cannot be held liable for the loss of any such articles that are forwarded to us. <br />
            Re-cleaning <br />
            We inspect every garment before returning them to you to ensure that they meet our strict quality measures. It should be noted, however, that we may not be able to remove all stains safely from your garments but we will make every attempt to remove stains without damage to your garment. <br />
            Privacy <br />
            We will use your customer information in the regular course of providing services to you. We respect your privacy and warrant that any information you give us will be held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. <br />
